    <h1>Privacy policy of the Mobistudy researchers platform</h1>
    <h2>Version 2020-10-28</h2>

    <p>
        The Mobistudy website is used by researchers to set up mobile-based studies and retrieve data from participants.
        In order to use the website you will need to create an account with your email and password. These are needed to
        allow logging in into the system and to recover the password in case you lose it.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to create a study, you will first need to be invited to join a team, this is done by the Mobistudy
        staff using your email address.
    </p>

    <p>
        When you create a study, you will enter information about the study including who are the main investigators and
        their institutions. This information may also be related to you and will be shared with all potential
        participants that have been matched by the platform.
    </p>


    <p>
        All the data collected about you are securely transferred and stored on a server hosted and managed by the
        University of Malmö, Sweden. Data is encrypted at rest and during transmission. Personnel from the University of
        Malmö may access the server and your data for technical maintenance, but will not process any of these data for
        research purposes, but may publish general statistics about the number of users registered on the platform and
        the institutions they belong to.
    </p>

    <p>
        Under no circumstances other than the ones specified above, will your data be shared with other parties or
        individuals.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your data are kept on the server for as long as you decide to keep your profile on Mobistudy. If you want your
        profile to be removed you will have to contact the Mobsitudy staff. Please be aware that if you have declared
        any personal information as part of a configuration of a study, for example by listing yourself as a study
        investigator, this information cannot be removed as it is needed for audit by both participants and authorities.
    </p>

    <p>
        The server will also record technical logs containing the date and time you send or request data and the IP
        address from which the data comes from, but not the data associated with the request. These technical logs are
        needed for security audit and will be kept for 1 year in all circumstances, also if you decide to delete your
        account.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can download the data in a machine-readable format. Contact mobistudy@mau.se if you need to.
    </p>

    <p>
        Malmö University is the Controller of the processing of personal information which is done based on your
        consent. The consent can be revoked at any time by contacting mobistudy@mau.se and any material processed based
        on your previous consent will be erased. The same address applies if you would like to find out what has been
        registered about you or if you would like to have errors corrected, information erased or processing restricted.
    </p>

    <p>
