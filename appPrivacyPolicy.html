    research studies using their mobile phones.
    In order to use the app you will need to create an account on the Mobistudy
    server. This profile is needed regardless of whether you join a
    research study or not. The profile requires the following information:

      Your email address.
      This is needed to identify you, allow you to login and to recover your password.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your name and surname.
      These may be needed to personalise messages sent to you or in those studies
      where it will be necessary to identify each participant.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your date of birth.
      This is needed to match your profile with the inclusion criteria of available studies.
    </li>
    <li>

    5 years in all circumstances, also if you decide to delete your account.
