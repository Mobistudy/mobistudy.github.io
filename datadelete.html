            <h2>Delete your account and/or data:</h2>

            <p>
                By default, your profile data will not be deleted from our servers. Any data associated with a study you
                have participated in will be removed from the servers soon after the end of the study, but the data may
                be kept for longer periods by the researchers, as specified in the study-specific privacy policy.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can delete your account using the app, by opening the profile section and clicking on "Delete
                Account".
                This will delete all the data permanently for all studies no the Mobistudy server, but data that has
                been downloaded by researchers for analysis will not be deleted automatically. You will need to contact
                the researchers team in order to have study-related data deleted.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you cannot use the app to delete your account, or if you want to have some of your data deleted or
                corrected, or for any other question please contact the Mobistudy team at <a
                    href="mailto:mobistudy@mau.se">mobistudy@mau.se</a>.

                Read the <a href="appPrivacyPolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for further information about how your data
                is handled and your rights.
